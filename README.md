# Project for SASS Workflow Setup

Project Created for practice of the SASS workflow setup using vim and vscode. In vscode, using the live sass compiler. Project runs on flask backend. (I could have written it in django since, it's simple but it's and overkill for such a simple project)

# Disclaimers 

The project's goal is to create and familiarize myself with the sass workflow. The design is from a Youtube channel called DesignCourse.
